## pasc
The pasc is a cross-platform command line tool that is intended to help with the development process of Free Pascal / Lazarus projects, assisting during development, testing, build and documentation.

It allows you to create projects, add tests, add automation to documentation, in addition to providing a watch command to monitor the projects folder for changes and thereby trigger the build and test report process.

An interesting feature is the ease with which a new project can be configured to work with vscode providing configuration files for build, to run tests, and even for watch project folder and to trigger build and tests.
